# CS-PhD-Application-fee-waivers

## Introduction and Background
During the long and stressful process of PhD applications, expensive application fees turned out to be an important factor that impeded me from applying for more programs. Some schools offer application fee waivers. However, as suggested by Prof. [Jesse Thomason](https://jessethomason.com/faq),
> You often can get application fees waived, and requesting waivers should not affect your application. Unfortunately, many schools and departments either intentionally or unwittingly make the procedure for applying for a waiver difficult to untangle.

In addition, sometimes the fee waiver is only available for people with specific citizenship or permanent residency. Therefore, I created this list of application fee waivers for a collection of schools (mostly in North America, in which PhD programs typically require an application fee), hoping that other students can save some time by finding this information.

Although this list notes for CS PhD application fee waivers, **most links should be generalizable to a graduate program or at least a graduate program in the School of Engineering or School of Art and Science.** People applying for other programs can also look for departmental fee waivers by either searching through the departmental website or messaging the admission office.

Each program will be followed by a link to the fee waiver information page and/or a short message indicating the limitation for application. For some US schools, application fee waivers will only be offered to US Citizens or permanent residents -- this will also be annotated.

If a school is not on the list, it **does not necessarily mean that they do not offer application fee waiver**. You can find information through search engines, probing into their application pages, or messaging the admission offices.

To add more entries or correct some entries, please submit a PR or open an issue.
